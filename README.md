## Thanks for visiting my profile

I'm self-taught developer, sysadmin — you name it.
I've been working a long time with **PHP** doing stuff with it while others said it to be impossible.
Really pashioned about different **arhitecturical** ways constructing applications.
Really open to work with different technologies and learning more and more.
Currently working with **OpenSource projects on my freetime**.
