## Thanks for visiting my profile

I work in software development with multiple different titles developer, sysadmin, security, etc...
My background comes from the PHP, however using usually just the language which is best fit for the job.
Been digging into software architecture, working with microservice based applications and using heavily DDD in the development.

Sandly nowdays too busy to work on any OpenSource and trying to manage the big picture.
However, always open to work with different technologies and learning more and more.
